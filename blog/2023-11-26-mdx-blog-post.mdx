Some recent changes to strengthen the brand, I am hoping to design a scalable company which can withstand the uncertain future.

In these trying times, it is important to take heed to the fundamentals of business when building a company.
This means, at the minimum, a company should be seperated from its founder. This problem is often referred to as
"dealing with the founder", and it has been a consideration of mine ever since the founding of each company.

This is with the intention of eventually trading corporate stock on the NYSE, hiring staff, brining on investors,
and scaling the risk/reward paradigm that has pervaded since our founding.
